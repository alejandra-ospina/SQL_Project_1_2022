Japan is now open for travel again since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Travelers going to Japan who are in search of cheaper housing may be interested in staying in a Hostel. Besides hotels, homestays such as Airbnb, and tradition Japanese inns called Ryokans, hostels are known for being a low cost option. In this project, I will be analyzing data on Hostels in Japan in order elucidate the most popular hostels and locations to stay. 
The data set was downloaded from Kaggle. The CVS file includes data from 300 different hostels all over Japan. I uploaded dat to BigQuery and created vizualizations with Tableau Public

#First, changing "summary.score" to "rating"
SELECT summary.score AS rating
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_Hostels_in_Japan_data.hostel_jpn_metadata_table’

#Second, ordering hostels by highest rating to lowest rating
SELECT *
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_Hostels_in_Japan_data.hostel_jpn_metadata_table’
ORDER BY rating DESC 

#Find how many hostels were in Tokyo?
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_Hostels_in_Japan_data.hostel_jpn_metadata_table’
WHERE City= Tokyo

#Find how many hostels were in Kyoto?
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_Hostels_in_Japan_data.hostel_jpn_metadata_table’
WHERE City= Kyoto

#Find how many hostels were in Osaka?
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_Hostels_in_Japan_data.hostel_jpn_metadata_table’
WHERE City= Osaka

#Find how many hostels were in Fukuoka-City?
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_Hostels_in_Japan_data.hostel_jpn_metadata_table’
WHERE City= Fukuoka-City

#Find how many hostels were in Hiroshima?
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_Hostels_in_Japan_data.hostel_jpn_metadata_table’
WHERE City= Hiroshima

#Which were the Prefectures ("Cities") with the cleanest hostels
SELECT *
AVERAGE(Cleanliness) AS average cleanliness
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_Hostels_in_Japan_data.hostel_jpn_metadata_table’
Where City= Tokyo

#Which were the Prefectures ("Cities") with the cleanest hostels
SELECT *

Where City= Kyoto

SELECT *

Where City= Hiroshima


As a results, it is seen that Osaka and Tokyo have the most expensive hostels out of the cities. Tokyo having about 116 hostels; Osaka with 89; and Kyoto with 66. Security and cleanliness was similar among the hostels with Hiroshima having the highest score for both security and cleanliness at 9.3 and 9.5 rounded respectively.
