Japan is now open for travel again since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Travelers going to Japan who are in search of cheaper housing may be interested in staying in a Hostel. Besides hotels, homestays such as Airbnb, and tradition Japanese inns called Ryokans, hostels are known for being a low cost option. In this project, I will be analyzing data on Hostels in Japan in order elucidate the most popular hostels and locations to stay.
The data set was downloaded from Kaggle. The CVS file includes data from 300 different hostels all over Japan. I uploaded data to BigQuery and created vizualizations with Tableau Public.

As a results, it is seen that Osaka and Tokyo have the most expensive hostels out of the cities. Tokyo having about 116 hostels; Osaka with 89; and Kyoto with 66. Security and cleanliness was similar among the hostels with Hiroshima having the highest score for both security and cleanliness at 9.3 and 9.5 rounded respectively.
