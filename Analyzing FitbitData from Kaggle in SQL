## For this analysis, I am using BigQuery. I uploaded information from two CSV files about physical activity tracked by Fitbit from Kaggle into a table in BigQuery. Then I wrote the following SQL to process the data.

## Begin with revewing data such as finding duplicates
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ID)
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyActivity_merged_table` 
 

SELECT DISTINCT ID
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyActivity_merged_table`
