## For this analysis, I am using BigQuery. I uploaded information from two CSV files about physical activity tracked by Fitbit from Kaggle into a table in BigQuery. Then I wrote the following SQL to process the data.

##Begin with revewing data such as counting duplicates
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ID)
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyActivity_merged_table` 
 
##Removing Duplicates of ID
SELECT DISTINCT ID
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyActivity_merged_table` 

##Checking Length of ID
SELECT LENGTH(ID) AS numbers_in_ID
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyActivity_merged_table` 

##Arranging Ids  by descending value of total steps during their daily activities
SELECT ID, TotalSteps
FROM first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyActivity_merged_table
ORDER BY TotalSteps DESC

##Finding the ID with the maximum steps by using the maximum steps found in the previous query:
SELECT Id
FROM first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyActivity_merged_table
WHERE TotalSteps= 36019
Row Id 1 1624580081

##Counting how many times there was a total of steps equal to or above 3,000
SELECT COUNTIF(TotalSteps>=3000)
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyActivity_merged_table` 

##Checking all columns between both files that have the same ID
SELECT *
FROM `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyActivity_merged_table` JOIN `first-sql-to-github1.kaggle_fitbit_data.dailyCalories_merged_table` USING (Id)
